# TimeSeriesAnalysis

‘Time’ is the most important factor which ensures success in a business. It’s difficult to keep up with the pace of time. 

But, technology has developed some powerful methods using which we can ‘see things’ ahead of time.
Time series models are very useful models when you have serially correlated data. Most of business houses work on time series data to 
analyze sales number for the next year, website traffic, competition position and much more. However, it is also one of the areas,
which many analysts do not understand.

Here I've done time series analysis on Airpassenger and oil data-set and also have built model using ARIMA and Exponential smoothing forecasts.
